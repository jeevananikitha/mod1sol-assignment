                <p><b>Akira Yoshino (30 January 1948)</b> is a Japanese chemist. He is a fellow of Asahi Kasei
                    Corporation and a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya. He created the first safe,
                    production-viable lithium-ion battery which became used widely in cellular phones and notebook
                    computers. He was a brilliant partner to both the other. Yoshino was awarded the Nobel Prize in
                    Chemistry in 2019 alongside M. Stanley Whittingham and John B. Goodenough. </p>

                <p><b>John Goodenough (July 25, 1922)</b> is an American materials scientist, a solid-state physicist,
                    and a Nobel laureate in chemistry. He is a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science
                    at the University of Texas at Austin. He is widely credited with the identification and development
                    of the lithium-ion battery. He Yoshino was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 alongside
